# Rhino.Compute save Components Library for Grasshopper

## Introduction

Rhino.Compute Components Library is an open-source project designed to enrich the ecosystem of [Rhino.Compute](https://www.rhino3d.com/compute). This library provides a collection of components specifically tailored for working with headless Rhino documents, where traditional plugins often struggle. 

The mission of this library is to enhance, grow, and facilitate the development of Grasshopper scripts, making them more robust and user-friendly within a Rhino.Compute environment. By using these components, developers and designers can unlock new levels of efficiency and creativity in their computational design workflows.

## Features

- **Headless Environement Save**: Components that are designed to work seamlessly in a headless Rhino environment.
- **Grasshopper Compatibility**: Enhance existing Grasshopper scripts with robust and compute-ready functionality.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Rhino 7 or later
- Grasshopper
- Rhino.Compute server for testing and later deploy of GH_Scripts => [Rhino Compute Gitub Page](https://github.com/mcneel/compute.rhino3d)
