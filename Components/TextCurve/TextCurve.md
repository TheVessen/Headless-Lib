# HeadlessTextToCurve Component Guide

## Overview

The `HeadlessTextToCurve` component is designed to work within headless Rhino environments like compute. It enables the creation of text curves and offers several customization options for alignment, fonts, scaling, and positioning.

## Features

- **Input Parameters**: Text, Plane, Scale, Font, Horizontal Alignment, and Vertical Alignment.
- **Output Parameter**: Text Curves.
- **Customization**: Alignments and fonts can be specified for fine-tuning appearance.
- **Headless Support**: Created for use in headless Rhino environments.

## Inputs

1. **Text** (T): The text that should be displayed.
2. **Plane** (P): Plane of the text (default is XY).
3. **Scale** (S): Scale of the font.
